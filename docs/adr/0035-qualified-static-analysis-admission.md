## Decision

Configuration v2 can opt into `analysisProfile: "modelo-suite-static-v1"` together
with `selectionMode: "qualified-static-v1"`. Both values require each other.
Older runtimes reject the new selector instead of stripping an unknown profile
and silently producing a legacy positive result.
Legacy diagnostics retain their existing behavior. The named profile adds a versioned
`analysisAdmission` to the shared verification report. CLI, MCP and plugin use the same
application service. Rejection produces `BLOCK`; CLI returns 3 and the Action returns 1
even under `fail-on: none`. The structured schema rejects contradictory positive admissions.

Admission requires exact Git worktree-root selection, a Git-derived diff with resolved
commit identities, a current bound index, completed reconstruction and a non-empty
effectively analyzed change scope. The scope starts with both sides of the exact diff,
including renames and deletions, then closes over statically extracted imports, exports,
calls and dependency relations. Discovery outside configured selectors detects excluded
importers. Parse failure, unreadable sources, unresolved non-external imports and computed imports that could conceal
an inbound dependency prevent admission. Exclusions remain visible and never discharge
an obligated source. Unknown configuration/runtime semantics and deleted post-images
are conservatively outside this bounded ESM/TypeScript profile.

Source identity hashes raw bytes, including excluded/untracked source and repository
manifests, lockfiles and JSON/YAML configuration. It includes the generated analyzer
implementation digest; rebuilding a seal without consuming sources cannot restore it.
Reconstruction marks the old index incomplete before analysis and completes that state
atomically with the new snapshot. An interrupted rebuild cannot authorize the old graph.
Working-tree results use refreshed post-image symbol ranges. A final observation rejects
source, Git diff/commit or snapshot changes during analysis.

Binding, index freshness, repository coverage, change coverage, check freshness and
control freshness are separate fields. `DIRTY_KNOWN` means the exact dirty source was
indexed and sealed; `STALE`, `UNSEALED`, incompatible implementation/configuration or
partial obligated analysis refuse admission. Repository coverage may remain partial
outside the named change closure; the report enumerates both scopes.

## Proof boundary

Every required closure member must also have admitted Plane-A fact-use tuples.
The JavaScript registration covers the 22 declared ESM fact kinds for v2,
dialect 5.9.3 and `verify` / `change` only. It does not replace capability,
completeness, binding or freshness checks and grants no execution or approval authority.

`PASS` is a static analysis result. It does not prove test execution, Turbo cache
invalidation, failure propagation or pipeline execution. The report names those as
unobserved proof obligations and specifies the required observations. Static admission
qualifies only the named source/dependency subset, never runtime dependency completeness.
Built-in Node modules are an explicit external boundary; unresolved package/self-name
imports require resolution or a separately qualified profile.

Package qualification, installation, session loading and observed use are separate
states. Qualification is invalidated by any source, selector/configuration, Git coordinate,
analyzer, store or snapshot change, interrupted indexing or incomplete required coverage.
Consumers must retain the actual report and exit code on the exact candidate. Independent
aggregate review and negative witnesses are required before delivery; the modified
mechanism is not its own admissibility authority. Public fixtures contain no private
consumer source, documents or links. Approval gates, brokers and shared agent policy
remain a distinct project.
